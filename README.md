# FishOnTheGoApi
This is the codebase for the API which will be used by my application FishOnTheGo, more to be added soon.
This will be an app based around fishing location data and tracking your catch. 
Technology which will be used...
Frontend - Flutter
Api - REST or GraphQL (undecided)
Data DB - Likely Azure Cosmos DB or cheaper alternative
Image storage - Google Cloud Storage.
